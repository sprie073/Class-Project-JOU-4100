         <p> 
    
    <p>My interest for soccer started when i was very young as i both played and watched as often as i could. I started out by watching FC Barcelona a team that is based in Spain and plays in the Spanish soccer league called La Liga Santander.</p>

    <br>
    
    
       <p>At this time Barcelona were being coached by Josep Guardiola who is now one of the most highly regarded managers in the sport. He has this stature because of the very attractive style of soccer that he made his teams play with.</p> 
    
    <p>Not only did the manager of barcelona at the time really spark my interest in this beautiful sport it was also the commentary which was and continues to be done by two gentleman who go by the names of Ray Hudson and Phil Schoen.One of the reasons why i wanted to study journalism and more specifically sports journalism is because of these two commentators who helped me discover my passion to analyse and discuss the game of football/soccer. </p>
